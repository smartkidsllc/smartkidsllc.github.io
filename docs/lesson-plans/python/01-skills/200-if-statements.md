title: If Statements
description: How to make programs interactive
---

In the _Python_ programming language, if statements allow you to write code that only runs sometimes.

## Dependencies

Students need to have these skills before learning this skill:

- [Printing](printing)
- [Taking User Input](taking-user-input)

## Goal

When you teach this skill, your goal is to make it so that students can write code that looks like this:

```python
name = input("What is your name? ")
if name == "Perry the Platypus":
    print("Curse you Perry the Platypus!")
```

## Activities

Here are some activities that you can do in order to teach this skill.

### Writing on the board

1. Write this code on the board:

    ```python
    favorite_color = input("What is your favorite color? ")
    if favorite_color == "Orange":
        print("Thatâ€™s my favorite color too!")
    ```

2. Ask students what they think that code is going to do.

3. After calling on a few students, reveal the correct answer.

4. Ask all students to write similar code on their computers. Their code should ask a different question an react to a different answer.

5. Have students run their code in order to make sure that it works.
