description: When you’re coding, what are you even doing?
---

Most kids come to coding class not knowing what coding is. I think that that’s a problem.

## Dependencies

This skill has no dependencies.

## Goal

When you teach this skill, your goal is to make sure that students know the following vocabulary words:

- Computer: A machine that follows instructions\*
- Code: Instructions for a computer
- Software: Another word for code
- Piece of Software: A creative work that’s made out of code. It’s like a piece of art or a piece of music, but with code.
- Web browser: A piece of software that allows you to access Web sites.

Students who have this skill should also be able to do the following:

- Name a few pieces of software.
- Name a few Web sites.

\*Technically, that definition isn’t quite accurate, but the 100% accurate definition is more complicated in an unhelpful way.

## Activities

Here are some activities that you can do in order to teach this skill.

### Verbal quiz

Ask the class what a computer is. Call on a few different people before revealing the correct answer. Then ask the class what code is. Call on a few different people before revealing the correct answer. Then ask the class what software is…

Don’t forget to make sure that the class can name a few pieces of software and a few Web sites.
