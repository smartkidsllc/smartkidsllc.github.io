It’s pretty easy to do math in the _Python_ programming language.

## Dependencies

Students need to have these skills before learning this skill:

- [Data Type Fundamentals](data-types)

## Goal

When you teach this skill, your goal is to make it so that students can write code that looks like this:

```python
print(1 + 2)
print(2 - 3)
print(3 * 4)
print(10 / 2)
```

## Activities

Here are some activities that you can do in order to teach this skill.

### Writing code on the board

1. Write this code on the board:

    ```python
    print(1 + 1)
    ```

2. Ask students what they think that code will do.

3. Ask a student to come up to the board and add another print line. Ask them to make the line do subtraction instead of addition.

4. Ask another student to come up to the board and add another print line. Ask them to make the line do multiplication.

5. Ask another student to come up to the board and add another print line. Ask them to make the line do division.

You’ll probably have to correct students when it comes to multiplication and division. Most students probably won’t guess that `*` is the symbol for multiplication and `/` is the symbol for division on their first try.
