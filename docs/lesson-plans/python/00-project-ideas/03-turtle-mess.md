title: Turtle Mess

The Turtle Mess project is my favorite project. It doesn’t require and advanced or intermediate skills, but it always ends up looking cool in the end.

## Dependencies

Students need to have these skills before starting on this project:

- [Turtle Fundamentals](/docs/lesson-plans/python/skills/turtle-fundamentals)
- [Infinite Loops](/docs/lesson-plans/python/skills/infinite-loops)

## End result

Once a student completes this project, the end result will look something like this:

```python
import turtle

while True:
    turtle.forward(100)
    turtle.left(11)
    turtle.forward(150)
    turtle.left(270)
```

### Potential variations

You should have students visit [this page](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html) so that they can discover new things that can be done with the `turtle` module. Have students try to figure out that page on their own but help them when they inevitably get stuck.
