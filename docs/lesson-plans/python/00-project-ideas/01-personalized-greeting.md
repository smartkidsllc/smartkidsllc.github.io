title: Personalized Greeting
description: Greet the user by their name
---

The Personalized Greeting project is very similar to [the “Hello, world!” project](hello-world). The only difference is that the program greets the user instead of greeting the world.

## Dependencies

Students need to have these skills before starting on this project:

- [Printing](/docs/lesson-plans/python/skills/printing)
- [Taking User Input](/docs/lesson-plans/python/skills/taking-user-input)

## End result

Once a student completes this project, the end result will look something like this:

```python
user_name = input("What is your name? ")
print("Hello,")
print(user_name)
```

### Potential variations

If you want to teach students about `str` addition (see [the Data Type Fundamentals skill](/docs/lesson-plans/python/skills/taking-user-input)), then you can have them do this:

```python
user_name = input("What is your name? ")
print("Hello, " + user_name)
```
