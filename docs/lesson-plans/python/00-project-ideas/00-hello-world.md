title: Hello World
description: The quintessential first program
---

A “Hello, world!” program is just a program that displays the phrase “Hello, world!”

It might seem easy to write a “Hello, world!” program, especially if you’re writing it in the _Python_ programming language. For adults, it typically is easy. For kids, it’s often deceptively challenging. Kids don’t necessarily know how to open a program on their computer or what parentheses are. That’s why it’s important to you make sure that kids have those skills before you have them start working on a “Hello, world!” program.

## Dependencies

Students need to have these skills before starting on this project:

- [Printing](/docs/lesson-plans/python/skills/printing)

## End result

Once a student completes this project, the end result will look something like this:

```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

### Potential variations

You may want to encourage students to include multiple lines that display different messages. You may also want to encourage students to write something that’s funnier or more interesting than “Hello, world!”
